This repo stores ideas and approaches to the microevolution of individual speaker's phonemes retrieved from recordings found on youtube

## Set-up
The project is written in python. It requires setting the environment using Pipenv. First ensure that `pipenv` is already installed - if not, type `pip install pipenv`.

Now, type `pipenv install` and `pipenv shell` et voila - you should be able to run scripts seamlessly now.

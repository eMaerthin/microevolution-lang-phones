Members of Congress,</text><text start="48.548" dur="1.602">I have the high privilege
and distinct honor</text><text start="50.15" dur="1.835">of presenting
to you the</text><text start="51.985" dur="1.501">President of the
United States.</text><text start="53.486" dur="2.136">(applause)</text><text start="61.961" dur="5.606">(applause)</text><text start="67.567" dur="3.871">The President:
Thank you.</text><text start="71.438" dur="0.8">Thank you so much.</text><text start="72.238" dur="3.17">Please.</text><text start="76.776" dur="1.735">The President:
Mr. Speaker,</text><text start="78.511" dur="4.738">Mr. Vice President,
Members of Congress,</text><text start="83.249" dur="3.504">my fellow Americans:</text><text start="86.753" dur="2.736">We are 15 years into
this new century.</text><text start="91.591" dur="2.803">Fifteen years that dawned
with terror touching</text><text start="94.394" dur="4.371">our shores; that unfolded with
a new generation fighting</text><text start="98.765" dur="4.371">two long and costly
wars; that saw a vicious</text><text start="103.136" dur="3.503">recession spread across
our nation and the world.</text><text start="109.375" dur="3.871">It has been, and still
is, a hard time for many.</text><text start="115.715" dur="4.238">But tonight, we
turn the page.</text><text start="119.953" dur="2.802">Tonight, after a
breakthrough year</text><text start="122.755" dur="3.738">for America, our economy
is growing and creating</text><text start="126.493" dur="3.436">jobs at the fastest
pace since 1999.</text><text start="129.929" dur="19.286">(applause)</text><text start="154.22" dur="1.869">Our unemployment
rate is now</text><text start="156.089" dur="2.536">lower than it was before
the financial crisis.</text><text start="158.625" dur="1.501">More of our kids
are graduating</text><text start="160.126" dur="1.769">than ever before.</text><text start="161.895" dur="2.702">More of our people are
insured than ever before.</text><text start="164.597" dur="13.948">(applause)</text><text start="180.68" dur="1.635">And we are as free
from the grip</text><text start="182.315" dur="3.437">of foreign oil as we&amp;#39;ve
been in almost 30 years.</text><text start="185.752" dur="4.7">(applause)</text><text start="193.259" dur="4.338">Tonight, for the first
time since 9/11,</text><text start="197.597" dur="3.236">our combat mission in
Afghanistan is over.</text><text start="200.833" dur="5.005">(applause)</text><text start="206.539" dur="2.169">Six years ago,
nearly 180,000</text><text start="208.708" dur="3.403">American troops served in
Iraq and Afghanistan.</text><text start="212.111" dur="3.56">Today, fewer than
15,000 remain.</text><text start="215.68" dur="3.2">And we salute the courage
and sacrifice of every man</text><text start="218.885" dur="2.736">and woman in this 9/11
Generation who has</text><text start="221.621" dur="1.835">served to
keep us safe.</text><text start="223.456" dur="1.602">(applause)</text><text start="225.058" dur="2.969">We are humbled and
grateful for your service.</text><text start="228.027" dur="4.84">(applause)</text><text start="258.725" dur="3.436">America, for all that
we have endured;</text><text start="262.161" dur="4.104">for all the grit and hard
work required to come back;</text><text start="266.265" dur="4.038">for all the tasks that
lie ahead, know this:</text><text start="270.303" dur="2.536">The shadow of crisis
has passed, and the</text><text start="272.839" dur="2.736">State of the
Union is strong.</text><text start="275.575" dur="3.54">(applause)</text><text start="288.855" dur="3.303">At this moment -- with
a growing economy,</text><text start="292.158" dur="4.638">shrinking deficits, bustling
industry, booming energy</text><text start="296.796" dur="3.237">production -- we have
risen from recession</text><text start="300.033" dur="3.436">freer to write our own
future than any other</text><text start="303.469" dur="2.803">nation on Earth.</text><text start="306.272" dur="3.303">It&amp;#39;s now up to us to
choose who we want</text><text start="309.575" dur="2.97">to be over the next 15 years
and for decades to come.</text><text start="314.714" dur="2.069">Will we accept an
economy where only a few</text><text start="316.783" dur="3.003">of us do
spectacularly well?</text><text start="319.786" dur="2.002">Or will we commit
ourselves to an economy</text><text start="321.788" dur="2.369">that generates rising
incomes and chances</text><text start="324.157" dur="2.969">for everyone who
makes the effort?</text><text start="327.126" dur="3.68">(applause)</text><text start="334.333" dur="3.604">Will we approach the world
fearful and reactive,</text><text start="337.937" dur="2.269">dragged into costly
conflicts that strain</text><text start="340.206" dur="3.136">our military and set
back our standing?</text><text start="343.342" dur="3.404">Or will we lead wisely,
using all elements</text><text start="346.746" dur="2.502">of our power to defeat
new threats and protect</text><text start="349.248" dur="2.472">our planet?</text><text start="351.72" dur="3.26">Will we allow ourselves to
be sorted into factions</text><text start="354.987" dur="2.673">and turned against
one another?</text><text start="357.66" dur="2.86">Or will we recapture the
sense of common purpose</text><text start="360.526" dur="2.036">that has always propelled
America forward?</text><text start="364.964" dur="3.737">In two weeks, I will send
this Congress a budget</text><text start="368.701" dur="4.338">filled with ideas that are
practical, not partisan.</text><text start="373.039" dur="2.002">And in the months ahead,
I&amp;#39;ll crisscross the</text><text start="375.041" dur="4.471">country making a
case for those ideas.</text><text start="379.512" dur="2.903">So tonight, I want to
focus less on a checklist</text><text start="382.415" dur="3.603">of proposals, and focus
more on the values</text><text start="386.018" dur="2.169">at stake in the
choices before us.</text><text start="390.79" dur="2.002">It begins with
our economy.</text><text start="394.894" dur="3.77">Seven years ago,
Rebekah and Ben Erler</text><text start="398.664" dur="3.504">of Minneapolis
were newlyweds.</text><text start="402.168" dur="4.404">(laughter)</text><text start="409.075" dur="1.835">She waited
tables.</text><text start="410.91" dur="2.703">He worked
construction.</text><text start="413.613" dur="4.037">Their first child,
Jack, was on the way.</text><text start="417.65" dur="4.171">They were young and
in love in America.</text><text start="421.821" dur="2.002">And it doesn&amp;#39;t get
much better than that.</text><text start="426.225" dur="2.97">&amp;quot;If only we had known,&amp;quot;
Rebekah wrote to me last</text><text start="429.195" dur="3.103">spring, &amp;quot;what was about
to happen to the housing</text><text start="432.298" dur="3.27">and construction
market.&amp;quot;</text><text start="435.568" dur="2.903">As the crisis worsened,
Ben&amp;#39;s business dried up,</text><text start="438.471" dur="2.903">so he took what jobs he
could find, even if they</text><text start="441.374" dur="4.304">kept him on the road for
long stretches of time.</text><text start="445.678" dur="2.336">Rebekah took out student
loans and enrolled</text><text start="448.014" dur="3.436">in community college, and
retrained for a new career.</text><text start="453.586" dur="3.036">They sacrificed
for each other.</text><text start="456.622" dur="2.97">And slowly, it
paid off.</text><text start="459.592" dur="2.269">They bought
their first home.</text><text start="461.861" dur="2.703">They had a second
son, Henry.</text><text start="464.564" dur="3.603">Rebekah got a better
job and then a raise.</text><text start="468.167" dur="2.236">Ben is back in
construction -- and</text><text start="470.403" dur="2.002">home for dinner
every night.</text><text start="473.906" dur="3.17">&amp;quot;It is amazing,&amp;quot; Rebekah
wrote, &amp;quot;what you can</text><text start="477.076" dur="5.005">bounce back from when you
have to...we are a strong,</text><text start="482.081" dur="2.436">tight-knit family who
has made it through some</text><text start="484.517" dur="4.104">very, very
hard times.&amp;quot;</text><text start="488.621" dur="2.402">&amp;quot;We are a strong,
tight-knit family who</text><text start="491.023" dur="2.603">has made it through some
very, very hard times.&amp;quot;</text><text start="495.862" dur="3.57">America, Rebekah and
Ben&amp;#39;s story is our story.</text><text start="501.534" dur="2.035">They represent the
millions who have worked</text><text start="503.569" dur="4.838">hard and scrimped, and
sacrificed and retooled.</text><text start="508.407" dur="2.536">You are the reason that
I ran for this office.</text><text start="513.279" dur="2.736">You are the people I was
thinking of six years</text><text start="516.015" dur="4.08">ago today, in the darkest
months of the crisis,</text><text start="520.1" dur="2.12">when I stood on the steps of
this Capitol and promised</text><text start="522.221" dur="4.438">we would rebuild our economy
on a new foundation.</text><text start="526.659" dur="3.637">And it has been your
resilience, your effort</text><text start="530.296" dur="2.002">that has made it
possible for our country</text><text start="532.298" dur="3.67">to emerge stronger.</text><text start="535.968" dur="2.002">We believed we could
reverse the tide</text><text start="537.97" dur="3.537">of outsourcing and draw
new jobs to our shores.</text><text start="541.507" dur="2.002">And over the past five
years, our businesses</text><text start="543.509" dur="2.302">have created more than
11 million new jobs.</text><text start="545.811" dur="4.12">(applause)</text><text start="562.828" dur="1.435">We believed we could
reduce our dependence</text><text start="564.263" dur="3.404">on foreign oil and
protect our planet.</text><text start="567.667" dur="3.803">And today, America is
number one in oil and gas.</text><text start="571.47" dur="3.27">America is number
one in wind power.</text><text start="574.74" dur="2.269">Every three weeks, we
bring online as much</text><text start="577.009" dur="4.104">solar power as we
did in all of 2008.</text><text start="581.113" dur="1.068">(applause)</text><text start="582.181" dur="1.635">And thanks to
lower gas prices</text><text start="583.816" dur="2.803">and higher fuel standards,
the typical family</text><text start="586.619" dur="4.004">this year should save
about $750 at the pump.</text><text start="590.623" dur="4.671">(applause)</text><text start="598.564" dur="2.002">We believed we could
prepare our kids for</text><text start="600.566" dur="1.769">a more competitive
world.</text><text start="602.335" dur="2.102">And today, our younger
students have earned the</text><text start="604.437" dur="3.103">highest math and reading
scores on record.</text><text start="607.54" dur="2.002">Our high school
graduation rate has</text><text start="609.542" dur="1.968">hit an
all-time high.</text><text start="611.51" dur="3.704">More Americans finish
college than ever before.</text><text start="615.214" dur="5.072">(applause)</text><text start="621.187" dur="1.868">We believed that sensible
regulations could</text><text start="623.055" dur="4.104">prevent another crisis,
shield families from ruin,</text><text start="627.159" dur="2.903">and encourage
fair competition.</text><text start="630.062" dur="2.236">Today, we have new tools
to stop taxpayer-funded</text><text start="632.298" dur="2.536">bailouts, and a new
consumer watchdog</text><text start="634.834" dur="2.769">to protect us from predatory
lending and abusive</text><text start="637.603" dur="2.302">credit card
practices.</text><text start="639.905" dur="2.703">And in the past year
alone, about 10 million</text><text start="642.608" dur="2.102">uninsured Americans
finally gained</text><text start="644.71" dur="1.568">the security of
health coverage.</text><text start="646.28" dur="4.2">(applause)</text><text start="664.163" dur="3.27">At every step, we were
told our goals were</text><text start="667.433" dur="4.304">misguided or too
ambitious; that</text><text start="671.737" dur="4.204">we would crush jobs
and explode deficits.</text><text start="675.941" dur="2.002">Instead, we&amp;#39;ve seen the
fastest economic growth</text><text start="677.943" dur="2.636">in over a decade,
our deficits cut</text><text start="680.579" dur="3.17">by two-thirds, a stock
market that has doubled,</text><text start="683.749" dur="2.336">and health care inflation
at its lowest rate</text><text start="686.085" dur="1.001">in 50 years.</text><text start="687.086" dur="4.96">(applause)</text><text start="701.634" dur="1.468">This is good
news, people.</text><text start="703.102" dur="4.171">(laughter)</text><text start="707.273" dur="6.573">(applause)</text><text start="713.846" dur="3.337">So the verdict
is clear.</text><text start="717.183" dur="2.802">Middle-class
economics works.</text><text start="719.985" dur="3.37">Expanding
opportunity works.</text><text start="723.355" dur="2.803">And these policies will
continue to work as long</text><text start="726.158" dur="3.437">as politics don&amp;#39;t
get in the way.</text><text start="729.595" dur="2.236">We can&amp;#39;t slow down
businesses or put our</text><text start="731.831" dur="2.035">economy at risk with
government shutdowns</text><text start="733.866" dur="3.07">or fiscal showdowns.</text><text start="736.936" dur="2.135">We can&amp;#39;t put the security
of families at risk</text><text start="739.071" dur="3.637">by taking away their health
insurance, or unraveling</text><text start="742.708" dur="2.77">the new rules on Wall
Street, or refighting</text><text start="745.478" dur="2.002">past battles on
immigration when we&amp;#39;ve</text><text start="747.48" dur="4.304">got to fix a
broken system.</text><text start="751.784" dur="2.002">And if a bill comes
to my desk that tries</text><text start="753.786" dur="3.637">to do any of these
things, I will veto it.</text><text start="757.423" dur="1.735">It will have
earned my veto.</text><text start="759.158" dur="4.6">(applause)</text><text start="771.47" dur="2.269">Today, thanks to a growing
economy, the recovery</text><text start="773.739" dur="3.504">is touching more
and more lives.</text><text start="777.243" dur="3.403">Wages are finally
starting to rise again.</text><text start="780.646" dur="2.002">We know that more
small business owners</text><text start="782.648" dur="2.002">plan to raise their
employees&amp;#39; pay than</text><text start="784.65" dur="2.002">at any time
since 2007.</text><text start="788.287" dur="4.104">But here&amp;#39;s the thing:
Those of us here tonight,</text><text start="792.391" dur="2.536">we need to set our sights
higher than just making</text><text start="794.927" dur="2.803">sure government doesn&amp;#39;t
screw things up;</text><text start="797.73" dur="3.57">that government doesn&amp;#39;t halt
the progress we&amp;#39;re making.</text><text start="801.3" dur="3.57">We need to do more
than just do no harm.</text><text start="804.87" dur="4.405">Tonight, together, let&amp;#39;s
do more to restore</text><text start="809.275" dur="3.37">the link between hard work
and growing opportunity</text><text start="812.645" dur="1.801">for every American.</text><text start="814.446" dur="4.32">(applause)</text><text start="830.162" dur="2.369">Because families
like Rebekah&amp;#39;s still</text><text start="832.531" dur="2.469">need our help.</text><text start="835" dur="3.437">She and Ben are working
as hard as ever,</text><text start="838.437" dur="3.07">but they&amp;#39;ve had to forego
vacations and a new car</text><text start="841.507" dur="3.203">so that they can pay off student
loans and save for retirement.</text><text start="847.112" dur="4.171">Friday night pizza,
that&amp;#39;s a big splurge.</text><text start="851.283" dur="3.17">Basic childcare for Jack
and Henry costs more than</text><text start="854.453" dur="3.036">their mortgage, and almost
as much as a year at the</text><text start="857.489" dur="2.002">University of
Minnesota.</text><text start="861.026" dur="3.17">Like millions of
hardworking Americans,</text><text start="864.196" dur="3.137">Rebekah isn&amp;#39;t asking
for a handout, but she</text><text start="867.333" dur="2.802">is asking that we look
for more ways to help</text><text start="870.135" dur="2.002">families get ahead.</text><text start="873.272" dur="2.002">And in fact, at every
moment of economic</text><text start="875.274" dur="2.569">change throughout our
history, this country</text><text start="877.843" dur="3.237">has taken bold action to
adapt to new circumstances</text><text start="881.08" dur="4.504">and to make sure everyone
gets a fair shot.</text><text start="885.584" dur="1.702">We set up worker
protections,</text><text start="887.286" dur="3.837">Social Security, Medicare,
Medicaid to protect</text><text start="891.123" dur="3.637">ourselves from the
harshest adversity.</text><text start="894.76" dur="2.936">We gave our citizens
schools and colleges,</text><text start="897.696" dur="3.003">infrastructure and the
Internet -- tools they</text><text start="900.699" dur="2.303">needed to go as far as
their effort and their</text><text start="903.002" dur="3.103">dreams will
take them.</text><text start="906.105" dur="2.903">That&amp;#39;s what middle-class
economics is --</text><text start="909.008" dur="3.37">the idea that this country
does best when everyone gets</text><text start="912.378" dur="4.537">their fair shot, everyone
does their fair share,</text><text start="916.915" dur="2.236">everyone plays by the
same set of rules.</text><text start="919.151" dur="5.28">(applause)</text><text start="927.159" dur="1.568">We don&amp;#39;t just want
everyone to share</text><text start="928.727" dur="2.002">in America&amp;#39;s success,
we want everyone</text><text start="930.729" dur="2.102">to contribute to
our success.</text><text start="932.831" dur="5.172">(applause)</text><text start="938.003" dur="2.002">So what does middle-class
economics require</text><text start="940.005" dur="2.202">in our time?</text><text start="943.542" dur="3.17">First, middle-class
economics means helping</text><text start="946.712" dur="3.27">working families feel
more secure in a world</text><text start="949.982" dur="2.836">of constant change.</text><text start="952.818" dur="3.036">That means helping folks
afford childcare, college,</text><text start="955.854" dur="4.472">health care, a
home, retirement.</text><text start="960.326" dur="2.302">And my budget will address
each of these issues,</text><text start="962.628" dur="2.135">lowering the taxes
of working families</text><text start="964.763" dur="2.202">and putting thousands
of dollars back into</text><text start="966.965" dur="1.102">their pockets
each year.</text><text start="968.067" dur="6.106">(applause)</text><text start="975.841" dur="1.568">Here&amp;#39;s one
example.</text><text start="977.409" dur="1.835">During World War
II, when men like</text><text start="979.244" dur="4.472">my grandfather went off to war,
having women like my grandmother</text><text start="983.716" dur="4.237">in the workforce was a
national security priority</text><text start="987.953" dur="2.169">-- so this country provided
universal childcare.</text><text start="992.191" dur="2.369">In today&amp;#39;s economy, when
having both parents in the</text><text start="994.56" dur="4.571">workforce is an economic 
necessity for many families,</text><text start="999.131" dur="2.002">we need affordable,
high-quality</text><text start="1001.133" dur="1.568">childcare more

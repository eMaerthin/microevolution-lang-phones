alright so let's move on to the
01:55
foundation day one so the first
01:57
foundation we're gonna be trying out is
01:58
the brand new Dior skin this is
02:00
obviously a little sample which I'll
02:01
explain about your skin forever under
02:03
cover foundation the name forever under
02:05
cover just makes me think of Quantico or
02:07
like Carmen Sandiego good show if you
02:10
haven't seen it this is new I'm actually
02:11
filming this video in February so it
02:13
just launched right now I never really
02:15
review like the samples I always
02:17
purchase the full bottle but I had the
02:18
full bottle in my car and Sephora and
02:20
then I saw they had the deluxe sample
02:22
sizes so I trashed the full bottle got
02:24
the samples which is why we have this
02:26
and I actually had the lightest shade if
02:28
I do like it I'll end up just purchasing
02:30
the full bottle so the full-size
02:31
foundation retails for $52 but it has
02:34
one point three ounces of product which
02:35
is a little bit more than standard one
02:37
fluid ounce it comes in 24 shades I have
02:39
a light
02:39
which is ten ivory which says very light
02:41
with neutral undertone also got the
02:43
shade 20 as a sample there's a few
02:45
shades in between 10 and 20 14 15 does
02:48
it 14 15 but I'm also gonna swatch this
02:50
one since I have it and says this for
02:51
all skin types
02:52
24 our full coverage water-based
02:55
foundation supposed to be the most
02:56
extreme wear foundation yet from Dior
02:58
full coverage lightweight formula with a
03:00
natural matte finish says it contains
03:02
the highest level of pigments out of any
03:04
do our foundation almost twice that of
03:06
the original forever fluid foundation
03:08
for an even fuller coverage it's
03:10
supposed to be like second skin and I
03:13
think that's pretty much it so I'm gonna
03:14
search swatches out here so you can see
03:15
what the shades 10 and 20 look like next
03:17
to some of my other foundations alright
03:19
so swatch time right here is the dew our
03:20
foundation in the lightest shade 10 next
03:23
over is the shade 20 and these both have
03:26
already oxidized since I first watched
03:27
them I can see it as it's drying to the
03:29
center where it's still a little bit
03:30
more wet is about a shade lighter than
03:33
the outside or it's already dried down
03:34
next over is the NARS radiant foundation
03:36
in the shade and Mont Blanc I have a
03:38
whole video on this along with every
03:39
other one of these foundations
03:41
derman called 2:08 which is my closest
03:43
shade match Tarte rainforest of the sea
03:45
foundation in porcelain Maybelline fit
03:47
me matte and poreless in 110 I don't
03:48
like this foundation at all I only
03:50
include it in swatches because it's a
03:51
fair shade from the drugstore that you
03:53
can compare to and then milk makeup blur
03:54
liquid in the lightest shade fair if
03:57
you're excited for this video don't
03:59
forget to give it a thumbs up if you're
04:00
new here you can join the burrito family
04:02
and subscribe I'm uploading every single
04:04
day 15th to 29th 6 p.m. tip time let's
04:07
do this alright I cannot believe this is
04:10
happening right now it's day 1 so it is
04:12
10:30 a.m. when I'm filming this it's
04:14
actually February 8 I've already washed
04:16
moisturize and prepped my skin I'm gonna
04:18
have the products linked down below I'm
04:19
not gonna be doing a half face with the
04:21
primer in this series because basically
04:22
all I've been doing is my usual
04:23
moisturizers and then I just put like 2
04:26
spritzes of this in my hand and just
04:27
kind of like Pat it all over my face and
04:29
that's pretty much how I've been wearing
04:31
my foundation every single day so that's
04:32
just basically to get my skin to a state
04:34
where it's nice and moisturized and
04:36
ready for foundation I'm gonna start out
04:37
with the shade 10 I've read the lightest
04:39
one because that's what I was in the
04:40
star foundation I'm gonna shake this
04:42
just in case supposed to be full
04:44
coverage in 24 hours of where I'm doing
04:47
my use my huge I'm gonna doing my usual
04:49
10 hour wear test looks a little bit
04:51
dark on there
04:52
we'll see how this goes this is a
04:53
lighter shade so I'm gonna start out
04:55
with my dampened Real Techniques sponge
04:56
on this side of my face
04:57
this one does feel different than they
05:00
used to it feels very thin like super
05:05
lightweight has a major scent why the
05:08
heck does Durer always do this their
05:10
star foundation smells like perfume and
05:13
this one does too
05:15
very heavily scented I just hate that
05:16
much fragrance and foundation this looks
05:19
beautiful on the skin with a sponge whoa
05:23
it feels like I have nothing on my face
05:25
right now like it feels super super
05:27
lightweight it's giving pretty good
05:29
coverage definitely it doesn't look like
05:30
full coverage with a sponge it's not
05:33
really covering the scarring on my neck
05:35
okay so from far away like when I was
05:36
just looking in the mirror it looks
05:38
amazing when I look really up-close it
05:40
looks a little bit patchy in certain
05:42
areas and it's actually like clinging a
05:43
little bit on my forehead up here bye
05:46
let's see what happens with the brush so
05:47
my skin is more normal to dry right now
05:49
I'm on 1/5 of accutane but right now my
05:53
skin is more just really on the normal
05:54
side off the bat definitely better
05:58
coverage with a brush but it still
05:59
doesn't look like full coverage you can
06:01
still see stuff coming through I would
06:02
say this is medium coverage the way they
06:05
describe this made it seem like super
06:07
super ultra double pigment full coverage
06:09
and it's definitely not this is
06:11
definitely a clinger like I said I don't
06:14
even have dry patches but just to
06:16
certain areas of my face where there's
06:17
more texture you can just kind of see it
06:20
sitting there around my nose it doesn't
06:22
look the best I'm gonna get really
06:24
up-close it's weird cuz I'm from far
06:25
away just like from a foot away when I'm
06:27
looking in the mirror it looks beautiful
06:30
it's just when you look really up close
06:32
that it's like whew
06:34
I'm hoping it's picking up on what I'm
06:35
really seeing in real life you can see
06:37
some of the clinging happening right
06:39
there and in this area look at the
06:41
center of my forehead looks very clingy
06:44
dry can you see that texture right there
06:47
seems to be already starting to crease a
06:49
little bit around my mouth area
06:51
if this doesn't oxidize I think the
06:53
shade actually works for me on camera it
06:56
looks like it matches it is a bit dark
06:58
in real life but not to the point where
06:59
it's too dark I'm gonna go in with the
07:01
sponge without product on it and just
07:04
try and kind of
07:05
smooth out my forehead and any of the
07:07
textured areas okay that didn't do a
07:11
whole lot still looking pretty crappy
07:13
yeah it's just a clinger as far as the
07:15
finish when I first put it on it looked
07:17
a lot more satin matte right now it
07:19
looks like more of just kind of a true
07:21
matte maybe like a soft matte it's not
07:23
the worst it just doesn't look
07:24
particularly good on my skin right now
07:26
one thing that I do like is that doesn't
07:28
feel super sticky and it doesn't seem to
07:30
be transferring at all when I just touch
07:32
my face typically I'll only set this
07:34
area of my face so that I can blend
07:35
powder products on top but I don't even
07:37
feel like I need to do that I'm gonna do
07:38
the rest of my makeup and I'll be right
07:39
back okay so now it's 11:40 we're gonna
07:42
call the check-in time eleven o'clock
07:43
since that's when I finished up with my
07:44
face makeup no idea why my makeup just
07:47
took me this long
07:47
I feel like day one I'm always like
07:49
false lashes full on makeup and by day
07:52
15 it's under eye bags and mascara so
07:55
pretty much the same thing as far as the
07:56
foundation this foundation has gone
07:58
through some phases I feel like when I
07:59
first put it on it looked very smooth
08:02
had a really pretty satin finish looked
08:04
really lightweight and now that it's
08:06
been on my face it looks pretty heavy
08:09
and a little bit cakey it's not looking
08:11
good so right now in my skin I'm not
08:13
liking this one but we'll see if it kind
08:15
of warms up to my skin throughout the
08:16
day hopefully I'm gonna start a clip
08:18
right here what it looks like in natural
08:19
lighting and then we'll do a flash test
08:21
this is what the foundation looks like a
08:22
natural lighting it's hella gloomy and
08:24
like dark outside right now even though
08:26
it's the morning not sure how the
08:28
lighting is gonna be but let's zoom in
08:31
so as you can see it looks pretty dry
08:34
and crusty up here camera has been
08:38
having a rough time focusing lately are
08:40
you okay bro look at that cover FX
08:43
highlight though all right so let's go
08:45
do a little flash test I'm hungry
08:50
it doesn't look bad it looks pretty good
08:53
with the flesh it looks nice and soft it
08:55
actually it's really flattering on
08:56
camera fifty thousand times better with
08:59
flash on than it does in real life so on
09:02
the rest of my face for contour today
09:03
use makeup geek this pan is friggin
09:06
magnetic what is the shade breakup cold
09:08
porcelain and blush I use a zoeva I
09:10
think the shade is shy beauty but this
09:12
is the zoeva blush I got this off of
09:14
Blaine by it's a super pretty like
09:16
peachy pink shade highlight I've been
09:17
obsessed with this this is the
09:18
coverfx moonlight highlight all of my
09:20
eyeshadows I'm wearing today are from
09:22
the blue it's going flying more feed 25g
09:25
palette this is a great palette 24 G not
09:28
25 my lashes are I'll or 1 21s now my
09:31
lips I did a combo of the black art
09:33
plush liquid lip this is actually from
09:35
Hot Topic I just did a whole video
09:36
testing out Hot Topic makeup and then
09:37
just on the middle I put on a little bit
09:39
of the healthy lip Physicians Formula in
09:41
all natural nude just to give it a tiny
09:43
bit of more warm tone to it next check
09:45
and I do will be in natural lighting so
09:47
I'll see you guys in a few hours
09:48
here right now so it's now 4 o'clock for
09:52
4 so it's been on for 5 hours it looks
09:54
about exactly the same as the last
09:55
check-in except now I'm getting creasing
09:57
on my upper lip oh by the way I filled
10:00
off my lashes so there's creasing
10:04
they're there on the other side too on
10:07
my upper lip and everywhere else looks
10:10
about the same if not a little bit worse
10:14
yeah it looks like the creases have
10:16
gotten worse right there I'm gonna check
10:18
back in with you guys at the end of the
10:19
night ok so I got a little sidetracked
10:21
and is actually now lips 1103 it's been
10:25
on for 12 hours this is a long way tests
10:27
I'm wearing a different fuzzy team
10:28
jacket I think you might even be able to
10:30
see on camera from here I'm gonna zoom
10:33
in I have been working on the computer
10:35
and I had my hand like this and that's
10:38
how I work almost every single day
10:39
normally my foundation doesn't come off
10:41
at all because I'm not like rubbing it
10:42
and it is a hundred percent rubbed off
10:46
right there like to the point where you
10:48
can see kind of where my hand mark was
10:51
and where my concealer stops that's
10:54
pretty extreme that completely came off
10:57
and then you can see the other side
10:59
which has a little bit rubbed off down
11:01
here but not anything like this side so
11:05
if you're looking for a transfer pure
11:06
foundation this definitely is not it not
11:09
only that but it feels dry like it's a
11:11
feels like a dry powder so it's weird
11:13
that it transferred that much besides to
11:16
transfer it it's a little bit hard to
11:19
tell on camera but I do think it's
11:21
oxidized about a shade maybe half a show
11:24
you to a shade it hasn't oxidized orange
11:27
which I like it's just darkened a bit I
11:29
mean the forehead and everything
11:30
looks exactly the same as last two
11:33
check-ins it just still looks pretty
11:34
heavy
11:35
kakie so this one for me is a know for
11:40
sure I'm really glad and purchased the
11:42
full bottle of this for 52 bucks this
11:44
might be one that looks great if you
11:46
don't have any kind of texture on your
11:47
face just go into it knowing that it's
11:49
definitely a matte medium coverage not
11:52
transfer proof if I really wanted to
11:53
like Salvage last few drops of the
11:55
sample bottle I would put on definitely
11:58
some kind of like smoothing primer
11:59
underneath definitely super dewy setting
12:02
spray over top it just has that look to
12:05
it though where I can tell it's still
12:06
going to be a cleaner I hope you guys
12:07
enjoyed a one if you did and you're
12:09

00:05
right now all right it's day average
00:35
time it rises - dog barks - Doug you
00:38
okay that sounds like a Sat park all
00:40
right so today
00:41
can I come hug you it is day five of 15
00:44
days of foundation this is where I try
00:45
out a new foundation every single day
00:47
for 15 days March 15th to 29th days one
00:50
through four I link down below in season
00:52
fives playlist today we're talking about
00:54
a brand new foundation by it cosmetics
00:56
this is their byebye foundation full
00:59
coverage moisturizer ignore my nails
01:01
that are already chipping one day later
01:03
this foundation retails for 39 50 and
01:06
you get one fluid ounce of product there
01:08
are CC cream actually retails for $38 so
01:10
this is just a couple dollars more for
01:12
whatever reason so they say this is
01:13
their first ever full coverage
01:15
moisturizer supposed to help cover and
01:17
improve the look of skin concerns
01:18
including redness pores dark spots
01:20
breakouts lines and wrinkles supposed to
01:22
flow over lines and wrinkles and feel
01:23
like nothing on your skin but cover
01:25
everything without creasing or cracking
01:27
ideal for all skin types so there are
01:30
only twelve shades here I've the
01:31
lightest shade which is fair the deepest
01:33
shade is deep says deep skin with
01:35
neutral undertone
01:36
they cosmetics CC cream only has seven
01:38
shades so just to give you a little bit
01:40
of background with a cosmetics CC creams
01:42
in my skin this one I do not like this
01:45
one I find to look way too heavy on my
01:48
skin a little bit cakey the regular CC
01:50
cream the illumination CC cream is one
01:52
of my favorite products to either wear
01:54
alone or to mix in with stuff when I had
01:56
oily skin this is definitely a product
01:57
that you need to set and it didn't last
02:00
the best on my skin but don't about it
02:01
makes your skin look very plump and
02:03
healthy I like do a skin I like that
02:05
glow a lot of people find that there's
02:07
kind of glitter in this one when I saw
02:08
that they were coming out with the
02:10
bye-bye foundation full coverage
02:12
moisturizer
02:13
to me it kind of sounds like this like a
02:14
full-coverage moisturizer kind of sounds
02:16
like a full-coverage CC cream you know
02:18
what I'm saying ingredients are very
02:19
similar in these the shade fair and this
02:22
one too this is actually the shade light
02:24
right here because I ran out of fair I
02:25
have to restock so I'm gonna soak those
02:27
swatches right now so you can see how
02:28
these three shades compared to some of
02:30
my other foundations
02:31
I've got swatches up the arm right now
02:33
cuz I'm doing a few days in one here
02:34
here's it cosmetics bye bye foundation
02:36
in the lightest shade fair next overs a
02:39
cosmetics CC cream in the lightest shade
02:41
fair there is a little bit of difference
02:43
in the undertones of these two shades
02:45
this is the cosmetics CC illumination
02:48
cream in the shade light because I'm out
02:50
of the shade fair so this is the second
02:51
up shade in that obviously quite a bit
02:54
darker than the first lighter shades
02:56
there's a big shade jump there next over
02:58
is a cover FX custom cover drops in n10
03:00
Marc Jacobs remarkable in lightest shade
03:02
10 cover FX power play foundation in P
03:05
20 NARS radiant foundation in Montblanc
03:08
CYO life proof in 101 derma called 2:08
03:11
and Maybelline fit me matte and poreless
03:13
in 110 I also have a review on the can't
03:17
remember what it was called off the top
03:18
of my head but the bye-bye foundation I
03:20
think it was just the compact one like
03:21
the cream foundation don't link that
03:23

03:36
shelter okay I have no idea have so much
03:38
energy this morning it's 703 right now I
03:41
was up at like 6 o'clock and literally
03:43
just popped out of bed but we're gonna
03:45
roll with it
03:46
I've already washed moisturize and
03:47
prepped my face as I was doing that I
03:49
had a little Sarah Bay disaster
03:52
literally squirt face wash all down my
03:55
arm into my hair like half the bottle
03:58
SEC you see remnants black hair problems
04:00
so at this easy illumination cream I
04:02
typically like to use a brush with this
04:03
we're still gonna do half face with a
04:05
brush half face with it sponge this
04:07
looks like almost the same packaging
04:08
this one is just like a tiny bit smaller
04:10
actually I love the packaging of this
04:11
because it's easy to travel with you
04:13
have this squeeze tube but you also have
04:14
a pump so it's not gonna break or
04:16
anything so let's start out with a brush
04:17
on this side of my face I was out on the
04:19
lake yesterday and got a little bit
04:20
sunburned
04:20
what's looking a lot better today
04:22
yesterday I was like a friggin tomato
04:29
smells exactly like the other CC creams
04:32
okay that's looking nice
04:36
okay I'm gonna drag this over cuz I just
04:38
got too much and blend it out with a
04:40
sponge on my forehead with a brush on my
04:43
forehead it doesn't look bad but I'm
04:46
definitely gonna use this sponge and
04:48
just smooth this out doesn't look like
04:52
total full coverage to me that is
04:54
sitting on my skin and dryness and
04:57
everything really nice it's a lot dear
05:00
than I was expecting
05:01
sponge time it smells very spa-like it
05:08
is pretty centered that bothers you this
05:11
scent doesn't totally bother me for some
05:13
reason it kind of smells just like fresh
05:15
and I've never found that because my
05:17
dick's products break me out ever if
05:19
anything the it cosmetics CC creams
05:22
actually I feel like every time I've
05:24
worn this for a significant amount of
05:25
time like stuck with that I was my sole
05:27
foundation my skin has actually gotten
05:29
better I've talked about that years ago
05:30
that is like one of the foundations that
05:32
I feel like has actually helped my skin
05:34
in the past now it's hard for me to
05:37
stick with the foundation that much
05:38
because I'm doing things like this
05:39
sponge side works too I feel like I got
05:42
about the same coverage for me this one
05:45
doesn't look like full coverage off of
05:46
one layer it's not covering my scarring
05:48
or freckles I'm going to try and just
05:50
build this up a little bit since I
05:51
already have some out here and I'm gonna
05:53
use the brush to do that I do like how
05:55
it applied better with the brush I feel
05:56
like the finish looks about the same but
05:58
a little bit better on the brush side so
06:00
I'm gonna build this up just on spots I
06:03
need it and you can build the CC cream
06:06
up to full coverage I was kind of
06:08
expecting this one to be a little bit
06:10
more full coverage off the go this side
06:13
is looking like a little bit more
06:14
textured or something okay so I just
06:21
added a tiny bit right in this area and
06:23
it still hasn't totally covered all this
06:25
so I don't think I would call this one
06:26
full coverage it did build a bit but if
06:29
you're going into this thinking this is
06:30
like ultra full coverage just not I
06:32
would say it's about the same cover just
06:33
a CC cream a little bit disappointing
06:35
because that's basically the difference
06:37
factor here I almost feel like this one
06:39
builds a little bit better like I can
06:42
get this one to total full coverage this
06:44
one I mean I can still see stuff I don't
06:46
not like how it looks I actually think
06:47
it looks really nice on the skin again
06:49
very similar to this
06:51
I'm actually not seeing like a huge
06:53
difference between the two this one is
06:55
very dewy we'll see if it gets a little
06:57
bit less dewy as it sets but the finish
07:00
yeah it feels very similar to that one
07:02
too has like a tacky finish this one
07:04
when I had oily skin I would definitely
07:06
have to set now that I have dry skin I
07:08
don't set it and that's what I'm gonna
07:09
do with this one as well it's just set
07:11
this part it is looking a little bit
07:13
almost like to do e oil e around my nose
07:15
area so I might set a little bit right
07:18
there too
07:18
but typically on my dry skin now when I
07:21
do that it looks too cakey right there
07:24
we'll see it we'll see how it sets down
07:25
if you already have this product at this
07:27
point I don't feel like you really need
07:28
this one but we'll see how wears
07:29
throughout the day this one might hold
07:30
up better but the shade is looking good
07:34
yeah I like the shade of it it looks
07:36
really nice on my skin it's not clinging
07:37
anywhere even around I have major
07:39
dryness right here and a little bit on
07:41
this side and it's not clinging at all
07:43
right there so right now at 7:19 I'm
07:45
gonna do the rest of my makeup drink
07:47
some coffee he'll be right back now 7:55
07:50
we're gonna call check-in times 730
07:51
since that's when I finish up with my
07:52
face I just did super basic makeup so
07:55
I'm about to go to a brunch breakfast
07:58
thing I feel like I'm already crashing
07:59
it's not even 8:00 I have kind of mixed
08:02
feelings right now my forehead it's not
08:04
even that it looks too dewy it's just
08:07
not Tom's making me look like older or
08:09
something it just looks like it's kind
08:10
of sitting on top of my skin down here
08:14
where I powdered it looks fine it looks
08:16
a little bit heavy I got a clip in
08:18
natural lighting so you guys can see and
08:19
I did see when I looked really in-depth
08:22
and was like staring at my forehead I
08:24
did see a couple specks of glitter as I
08:26
was moving my head we have Sun out today
08:28
so that's a rarity maybe that's why I
08:30
don't usually see the glitter but
08:32
directly in the sunlight I could see
08:33
like literally two specks of glitter
08:35
that doesn't bother me at all because I
08:37
really don't think you would notice it
08:39
unless you were staring at your forehead
08:40
there's something about this that I'm
08:42
not liking right now just kind of
08:43
surprised me like I don't know it just
08:44
looks like it's already separating on my
08:46
forehead kind of debating whether I want
08:48
to set my forehead or not but I think
08:50
because I don't like it how it is right
08:52
now and I wouldn't wear it how it is
08:54
right now so let's go ahead and do that
08:55
I'm just using my same laura geller
08:56
balance in Brighton powder this was on
08:58
hot look the other day for like 18 bucks
09:00
so I just bought it back oaks I'm
09:02
already hitting pan on this I'm not
09:04
gonna do right on the center I'm just
09:06
doing where it looks extra should be
09:08
which is up here from far away it looks
09:10
better let me go close okay there we go
09:13
definitely a bit better
09:16
I took a flash test before I just
09:17
powdered my face I'm gonna cert that
09:19
right here definitely in flash back
09:21
there was SPF 50 in this product so kind
09:24
of expected wouldn't wear this for flash
09:25
photography it also gave quite a bit of
09:27
shine right on the center of my forehead
09:28
right now I'm kind of indifferent to
09:30
this one right now I'm thinking if you
09:31
have this you probably don't need the
09:32
other one so on the rest of my face not
09:34
that anyone probably cares because it's
09:35
very basic but I use the butter bronzer
09:37
in the shade bronzer he's the butter
09:40
blush also by Physicians Formula in the
09:41
shade vintage Rouge whenever I use these
09:44
two products together like they're
09:45
butter bronzer in their blush everything
09:47
just blends so easily
09:49
you smell like coconuts it's a good
09:51
start to the day is a new NARS
09:53
highlighter again but in the shade
09:54
albatross this time no I think he's the
09:57
same shade name very pretty if you like
09:59
a yellow toned white shade as a
10:00
highlighter but also to use my lips were
10:02
boring I used like the same thing I've
10:03
been using I used L'Oreal tongue-tied
10:06
with the Maybelline vivid hot lacquer in
10:08
tease and that's oh and then eyeliner I
10:10
just smudged the L'Oreal infallible this
10:13
brown shade in brown just smudge that on
10:15
the top and bottom put it on my
10:16
waterline and then popped on my Too
10:19
Faced better than sex mascara and that's
10:20
all it's on my eyes I almost put on
10:23
false lashes again today the half ones
10:25
because did anyone notice I actually
10:26
kept those on all day yesterday
10:28
throughout the video I think that might
10:30
be the first wear test video I've done
10:31
where I actually kept my lashes on the
10:33
entire day we'll see how this holds up
10:35
throughout the day
10:35
next check and I do will be in after
10:37
lighting so I'll see you guys in a few
10:38
hours alright so I just got home it's 2
10:40
o'clock so it's been on for about six
10:42
and a half hours so it looks good it
10:44
looks like a satin finish at this point
10:46
I don't think I look too shiny on the
10:49
forehead that this is like a good amount
10:51
of radiant to me I feel like without a
10:54
powder it looks like Gracie just a bit
10:57
too dewy so I'm getting creasing right
10:59
here I was just doing a lot of talking
11:03
smiling so it did settle in right there
11:05
not bad on my upper lip as far as
11:09
creasing and then here's the center of
11:11
my forehead my forehead looks pretty
11:12
good I think I'm gonna go work out but
11:15
I'm just gonna walk on the treadmill for
11:16
like an hour so I'm not gonna be like
11:18
majorly breaking a sweat I just drank so
11:20
much dr. pepper so I'm like wired right
11:22
now so see you guys at the end of the
11:23
night it's 6:30 so it's now been on for
11:26
11 hours I did work out but I just did a
11:29
casual stroll no sweat happened watched
11:32
a good episode of blood line which by
11:34
the way it took them like 12 episodes
11:35
for it to finally get good but now it's
11:37
now it's turning into an actual show
11:38
nothing looks bad I just look hella dry
11:41
and a tad heavier than what I like I'm
11:45
in kind of a predicament with this one
11:47
because I feel like if I didn't set it
11:49
it would be so greasy looking which is a
11:53
lot to say on dry skin because I find
11:56
that that's pretty hard so if you have
11:58
anything other than dry skin this is
12:01
very very very dewy even if you do have
12:04
dry skin it to me looked a little bit
12:06
borderline too greasy hence why we
12:08
powdered then now I feel like my face
12:10
feels and looks really dry this probably
12:13
would be kind of a mixing one for me I
12:15
don't see myself really wearing this one
12:17
again I think what I would do something
12:18
like this is mixing like a couple drops
12:20
of the Catrice I quit coverage drop
12:22
foundation which I've been loving if you
12:24
want a matte foundation B of dry skin
12:25
just mix in a couple drops of that with
12:27
something else something like that is
12:29
how I'd probably wear this one if you
12:31
have the cosmetics CC illumination I
12:33
definitely don't think you need to get
12:34
the buy buy foundation and I'm a doing
12:36
person like I love a good dewy
12:38
foundation it's just a little much is
12:39
why I do kind of follow up the wrap up
12:41
video where I'm going to try in
12:42
different ways then you'll see my final
12:44
ranking and that's where I'll tell you
12:45
how I did wear it buddy I'm gonna try
12:47
the Catrice thing I also might like it
12:49
with a powder but then with a ton of
12:51
Duty settings bring over top to just add
12:53
that moisture back in feels weird
12:55
wrapping up a foundation video so early
12:57
in the night still have the whole night
12:59
to do stuff so I hope you guys enjoyed
13:01
day 5 if you did don't forget to give

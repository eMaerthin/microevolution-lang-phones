s she a Bratz doll are we 10 years old
00:02
I'm confused
00:07
[Music]
00:24
[Music]
00:30
alright so today it is day four of
00:33
fifteen days of foundation this is where
00:34
I try out a new foundation every single
00:36
day for 15 days days one through three
00:38
are linked down below in the season five
00:40
playlist so you can go back and watch
00:42
those if you missed any link to t-shirts
00:43
that down below 100% of the proceeds go
00:45
to project B share we're shooting to
00:46
raise $20,000 let's do this so today
00:49
we're talking about a drugstore cushion
00:52
foundation by wet-and-wild this is their
00:54
mega cushion foundation not a very
00:56
clever name so I got this off of Ulta
00:59
retails for $8.99 and you get 0.5 two
01:02
ounces of product in here I do have a
01:04
handful of other cushion foundation
01:06
reviews on my channel so you can just
01:07
search cushion foundation the Taylor on
01:10
YouTube and any will come up but just to
01:11
give you a comparison with size here and
01:13
the Maybelline Dream cushion foundation
01:14
you get 0.51 ounces of product choose
01:17
ones are in grams not helpful let's do
01:20
some converting here they're about 15
01:22
grams to 0.5 2 ounces so you do get the
01:25
standard kind of amount in this cushion
01:27
foundation that you do compared to
01:29
others so cushion foundations are a
01:30
Korean product in the last few years a
01:32
lot of American brands have been coming
01:33
out with them the Maybelline Dream
01:35
cushion we have the L'Oreal Lumi Mel
01:37
says is infused with coconut derivative
01:39
this luminous lightweight and buildable
01:41
formula helps boost hydration and
01:43
contains SPF 15 for added skin
01:45
protection so it doesn't actually say
01:47
what kind of coverage is supposed to be
01:48
it just as it's buildable just notes on
01:50
the back it also says it's vegan so this
01:52
is vegan and cruelty free so in both of
01:54
these cushion foundations it only comes
01:55
in 8 shades the big difference here is
01:57
that the wet-and-wild cushion foundation
01:59
has about 8 shades of light to medium
02:02
never brands have a shade range like
02:04
this where it starts at a number like
02:06
106 and it kind of jumps every few
02:08
shades with different numbering that
02:10
makes me think that they're gonna be
02:11
launching more shades hopefully so I'm
02:13
gonna search swatches right here so you
02:14
can see with the lightest shade of the
02:15
Wet n Wild mega cushion foundation looks
02:18
like compared to the dream cushion some
02:20
other cushion foundations and just a
02:21
couple others I'll throw in there got to
02:23
have that derma Col so these first three
02:25
right here are cushion foundations which
02:27
are a little bit tricky to swatch but
02:29
hopefully they're showing up for you
02:30
guys so right here is the wet-and-wild
02:32
cushion foundation and the lightest
02:33
shade 106 a next over is Misha magic M
02:37
in the lightest shade 21 and then the
02:38
Maybelline Dream cushion in the lightest
02:40
shade 10 so the wet wild one is the
02:43
out of these three cushions October's
02:45
cover effects power play and p20 this is
02:48
either coming or it's already up filming
02:50
swatches for another day right now
02:51
here's the CYO life proof in 101 NARS
02:54
radiant foundation in Mont Blanc
02:56
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless in
02:57
110 and derma called 2:08 so if you're
03:00
enjoying 15 days foundation while you're
03:01
watching don't forget to give this a
03:03
thumbs up if you're new here you can
03:05
join the BAE Rito family and subscribe
03:06
I'm uploading every single day the 15 to
03:08
the 29th 6 p.m. Pacific time okay so
03:11
it's 10:20 6 in the morning right now it
03:13
feels like it should be like 3 o'clock
03:14
I've already worked out and done 50,000
03:17
things so excited to try this I just
03:18
painted my nails so hopefully I can get
03:20
this box open here's what the packaging
03:23
looks like I'm not a huge fan of it I
03:26
feel like it almost looks like kids
03:28
makeup or something those cushion
03:29
foundations you get this compact that
03:32
should snap shut really well so the air
03:34
doesn't get in there okay well you just
03:38
have to really push that one then it
03:40
opens up just pop this thing open and
03:42
peel off the seal right there so I have
03:44
a couple cushion foundations that I
03:45
absolutely love the me shape magic mm
03:47
cushion foundation is probably my
03:49
favorite I'll link that one down below
03:50
you can get it for like 13 bucks on
03:52
YesStyle when it goes on sale so it is
03:54
pretty affordable if you get it on sale
03:55
but with most cushion foundations I do
03:58
typically like to use the applicator
03:59
that they come with because you just
04:01
kind of do this like press and roll
04:02
motion with cushion foundations and it
04:04
tends to give the best coverage doesn't
04:06
look as good with a brush doesn't look
04:08
as good with a sponge typically but just
04:11
for the sake of the review I'm gonna try
04:12
half my face with a brush so it says
04:14
this has coconut derivative mmm kind of
04:17
just smells like sunscreen alright here
04:19
we go so I'm just gonna press into here
04:21
looks like a decent amount of product
04:24
came out okay it looks a lot lighter
04:28
than it does in the cushion look at how
04:31
dark the cushion looks compared to the
04:32
actual product it's looking even lighter
04:34
on camera but in real life it looks
04:36
pretty dark but the shade looks pretty
04:40
nice so I'm going to do some press in
04:42
and roll in and it's going very far that
04:46
amount of product I do feel like I'm
04:50
having to work this in a little bit more
04:53
than usual with cushion foundations
04:55
because when you first put this on you
04:57
get kind of those lines with this
04:58
applicator so it's just taking a few
05:00
seconds longer than usual cushion
05:01
foundations are usually really really
05:02
quick
05:03
this isn't like long or anything it just
05:05
is taking a few more seconds
05:07
I'm gonna go down the neck to see if I
05:09
can cover my scarring down here it
05:15
definitely goes pretty far like I'm
05:17
gonna have to kind of drag this over
05:20
whew that looks good on the center of my
05:22
forehead it looks very smooth
05:24
okay I'm gonna kind of bring this over
05:26
because I do have too much product that
05:28
shade actually matches me very well
05:31
like the undertone and everything looks
05:34
really nice looking at my neck that's a
05:35
very very close shade match for me if
05:38
that doesn't oxidize
05:39
it looks very luminous but not too oily
05:41
or anything it's sitting on my skin
05:43
really nice it looks pretty good I am
05:45
getting again that crease mark right
05:47
here so I don't know what's going on
05:49
there maybe that's just my skin right
05:51
now I happened with yesterday's
05:52
foundation a little bit coverage with
05:54
this applicator I would say is low
05:55
medium coverage I still see a lot of my
05:58
skin coming through I can see scarring
06:00
freckles everything basically just
06:02
canceled out the redness which I've
06:04
actually been looking for something like
06:05
this just to go run errands with or to
06:07
whatever
06:08
I know cushion foundations aren't meant
06:10
to be used with a brush just for the
06:12
sake of trying it why not so I'm just
06:14
dipping my brush directly in here
06:22
it actually smells pretty scented when
06:24
it's on your face so the brush side was
06:26
a bit quicker I would say about 30
06:28
seconds quicker but I definitely prefer
06:31
the way that the cushion side looks it
06:34
looks like light coverage with the brush
06:35
I think I got a tiny bit better coverage
06:37
on this side but as far as the finish
06:39
and everything it looks really pretty
06:41
just looks like skin I'm gonna go in and
06:44
see if I can build this out but it is
06:45
supposed to be buildable so I think I
06:47
just got too much but we'll just burn it
06:49
to the other side
06:49
I just want to see how much coverage I
06:52
can get ooh that looks good
06:56
read this over here I don't want to
06:58
bring it right around my nose because I
07:00
do get creasing there so I'm just
07:03
keeping this right on the areas where I
07:05
want that extra coverage
07:07
I'm almost liking the way it applies
07:09
better just patting it rather than doing
07:11
the roll ooh that looks pretty ok now
07:18
we're at about hi medium coverage it's
07:21
covering a lot more of my scarring and
07:22
everything oh right now this is looking
07:25
freaking stunning hell yeah
07:29
looking real up-close the only thing I
07:31
notice is again these two marks which
07:34
might just be my skin right now it's
07:36
again that happened yesterday but look
07:37
at my forehead it looks so smooth it's
07:40
not settling into my lines up here it
07:43
just looks very healthy and glowy since
07:46
it is so glowy my pores are emphasized a
07:48
little bit around my nose so I probably
07:49
used my Revlon pore filling primer next
07:52
time I use this just in this area right
07:54
here to kind of fill that in a little
07:56
bit before I put on the foundation those
07:57
two layers on - it doesn't feel heavy or
08:00
anything feels just like I have a tinted
08:02
moisturizer on or something is
08:03
definitely tacky sticky though so I
08:06
would need to set this part of my face
08:07
that's usually what I do with the
08:08
products like this I don't like setting
08:10
my forehead because on my dry skin it
08:12
just does not look good and lasts pretty
08:13
well throughout the day without setting
08:15
it so far I'm really excited about this
08:17
one the shade everything the finish is
08:19
just exactly what I've been going for
08:22
lately so right now it's 1044 I'm gonna
08:24
do the rest of my makeup and I'll be
08:26
right back
08:26
all right the rest of my makeups on it's
08:28
now pretty much 11:40 I was having major
08:31
technical difficulties with this eyelash
08:34
but I think it's mostly on now we're
08:37
gonna call the check-in time eleven
08:38
o'clock since that's when I finished up
08:39
with my face makeup so I did end up
08:42
setting we're gonna the car
08:43
I set just like I said this part of my
08:45
face just with the laura geller balance
08:46
to brighten I think it looks beautiful
08:49
I am especially loving the way my
08:51
forehead looks I want to emphasize that
08:52
this is very glowy if you have dry skin
08:55
you'll probably love this if you have
08:57
oily skin you'll probably definitely
08:58
want to set this one that's how it is
09:00
with most cushion foundations if you
09:01
have oily skin you want them to last so
09:02
probably have to set it and I touch my
09:04
forehead it is still sticky so this
09:06
doesn't feel like one that sets down
09:08
have that bothers do you either set your
09:10
whole face of powder or don't get this
09:11
one that doesn't personally bother me
09:13
all right we're gonna do a flashes
09:16
button
09:17
come on so there is a little bit of
09:22
flashback probably because of the SPF in
09:24
there I almost wish they didn't put the
09:27
SPF in there because SPF 15 is such a
09:30
low amount that you could probably still
09:31
have to use her moisturizer underneath
09:33
with SPF in it anyways so if that's the
09:35
case then I would just rather have the
09:37
foundation not have SPF it's a little
09:39
almost as you can see out here I think
09:42
the shade is almost a perfect match
09:45
love the shade I love the amount of do
09:47
meanness and luminosity but that's just
09:50
me I'm loving the way it looks right now
09:51
no other complaints I'll see how it
09:54
wears throughout the day but so far so
09:56
good so on the rest my face for bronzer
09:57
I tried out the new Anastacio Beverly
09:59
Hills
10:00
tawny bronzer I ordered this and it
10:02
looked a lot lighter on line and in the
10:04
swatches I saw this one I think imma be
10:06
returning this is the second time I've
10:07
used this and I feel like it's just a
10:08
little bit too dark and warm for my skin
10:10
tone so I think I'm gonna be returning
10:12
this but the highlight I use this is the
10:13
Anastacio amrezy highlight and I mean
10:16
look at this thing this is such a
10:19
beautiful highlight I've kind of posted
10:21
a mini review on snapchat a couple weeks
10:23
ago views us about five times now I want
10:26
to say and every time I've used it it
10:27
kind of grows on me I've seen deeper
10:29
skin tones wearing this and I also feel
10:31
like this definitely works for fair skin
10:33
so that's awesome blush I use the
10:35
covergirl trublend blush in medium rose
10:37
eyeshadows I tried the BH Cosmetics glam
10:39
reflection this is the first time I used
10:42
the gold palette but they also had one
10:43
that had like a rose gold cover that I
10:45
gave to my cousin but so far Michael
10:47
out of both of these pallets our that
10:49
the mats are okay that they're not my
10:52
favorite mats ever but they are soft
10:53
they totally work and you can get a nice
10:55
blended look what I recommend that you
10:57
buy it probably not not my favorite
10:59
palette the BH Cosmetics has made and
11:00
the shimmer shades are very scratchy
11:01
shimmer shades are not good in these
11:03
ones I had an eyeliner struggle today
11:05
because I tried out this new eyeliner by
11:07
Smashbox this has always on liquid
11:09
eyeliner this one was fine not my
11:11
favorite eyeliner I think it worked but
11:13
I probably wouldn't reach for this one
11:15
again over some of my other eyeliners
11:17
and then this mascara I did not like it
11:19
all this is the super fan fanned out
11:21
mascara by Smashbox you want a super
11:23
natural mascara to the point where you
11:25
can't really tell you have my scare on
11:26
at all then go for this but if you want
11:30
a mascara that's really gonna do
11:31
something it did a whole lot of nothing
11:33
then I went in with these I'll or accent
11:35
lashes number zero zero five and I love
11:38
these normally I feel like my eyes burn
11:40
and I can't really keep lashes on an
11:41
entire day you've seen any of my war
11:43
chest videos I usually peel them off
11:45
after like an hour but these ones I mean
11:47
we'll see but I think I'm gonna be able
11:48
to keep these on all day because they're
11:50
not all the way to my inner corner they
11:52
don't feel too annoying like I feel like
11:54
I can keep these on my eyes now my
11:55
lipstick I did a weird combo I have
11:57
Milani matte naked this is one of my
11:59
favorite lipsticks ever the shade
12:01
beautiful but I wanted to lighten it up
12:03
a little bit so I went in with this gosh
12:04
lipstick which I don't think I've used
12:06
ever or in a really long time I got this
12:09
in London this isn't a shade baby lips
12:11
and it's like this light pink color but
12:13
it was one of those lipstick formulas
12:14
that just made my lips look so dry so
12:17
then I went in with this again on top of
12:20
it the Maybelline vivid hot lacquer and
12:22
the shade tease and I just love the way
12:24
that this lightens up any of your lips I
12:26
wear this in yesterday's video so that's
12:28
that folks so check-in time is 11
12:29
o'clock I'll see you guys in a few hours
12:31
in natural lighting
12:32
it says 542 so it's been on for almost 7
12:35
hours at this point I usually do
12:37
checking out like the five hour point
12:38
but I got totally sidetracked so here we
12:41
are there's still a little bit of light
12:42
out oh this is definitely just my skin
12:44
right now I just have like a major dry
12:48
patch right here totally peely from the
12:51
accutane I feel like my forehead doesn't
12:54
look bad but it could definitely look a
12:57
little bit better
12:58
it's just settling into my line
13:00
right here and then I feel like it's
13:01
kind of starting to separate right on
13:03
the center it doesn't look bad and I
13:05
feel like if I just use the cushion to
13:07
kind of smooth it out it would probably
13:09
look pretty good I'm not going to touch
13:11
it up just for the sake of the review
13:13
but this is what the rest of my face
13:15
looks like I'm getting really really
13:18
faint creasing on my upper lip not as
13:21
bad as usual it looks pretty good I
13:23
wouldn't say my face looks like
13:25
phenomenal after seven hours but I also
13:29
don't think it looks bad buy any mints
13:30
right now there's just a couple small
13:31
things so I'm gonna go get some sushi
13:34
with a friend come back here and I'll do
13:36
the final check in later time okay so
13:38
it's now 921 so it's been on for over
13:42
ten hours at this point and this is some
13:46
major peeling around my mouth now this
13:49
is like the first intense accutane
13:52
dryness peeling I've ever had I mean
13:56
we'll need to put some off before on
13:58
that take out this makeup but here's
14:00
what the rest of my makeup is looking
14:01
like I do feel like my blush and bronzer
14:04
has faded a little bit throughout the
14:06
day everything besides the obvious area
14:09
right here
14:10
I think looks pretty similar to the last
14:12
check-in the only thing I don't like is
14:14
that separation right on the center of
14:17
my forehead maybe I need a different
14:19
primer right there to really lock it in
14:21
on the center the rest of my point it
14:23
actually looks better now than I did at
14:24
last check and I feel like it actually
14:26
looks a little bit dewier it doesn't
14:28
feel too sticky yeah it's not coming off
14:32
and it doesn't feel too sticky it feels
14:35
a lot less sticky than earlier overall
14:37
so far I really like this one for dry
14:39
skin I feel like this is definitely a
14:40
product that I can kind of play around
14:42
with different primers and setting
14:44
sprays and find the best way to wear
14:46
this one because I do love the shade I
14:48
don't think it's oxidized throughout the
14:49
day I liked how it looked beautiful when
14:52
it first went on and there is a little
14:54
bit of work that could be done on the
14:56
forehead to make it look better overall
14:58
I'm into this one I would definitely
14:59
wear this again I would even wear it
15:01
again this is I mean it doesn't look bad
15:02
or anything at all I just think I could
15:04
make it a little bit better so whenever
15:06
I try them out with different products
15:08
I'll update you guys in the wrap-up
15:09
video which is going up on April 9th
15:10
that's also when I announce the winning
15:12
shelter the winning

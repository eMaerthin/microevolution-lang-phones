00:26
all right so today it's day two of 15
00:29
days of foundation this is where I try
00:31
out a new foundation every single day
00:32
for 15 days I'm gonna have the playoffs
00:34
link down below and every single day
00:35
where you can go back and watch other
00:37
days so right now obviously there's only
00:39
day one and the announcement video if
00:41
you are just stumbling across this video
00:42
and you haven't seen the announcement
00:43
video yet definitely go watch that you
00:45
don't forget to vote every single day
00:47
for your winning shelter in which city
00:49
you want there to be a meet-up in so
00:51
today's foundation is a new drug store
00:53
release this is the Rimmel lasting
00:55
finish 25 hour breathable long wear
00:57
foundation I don't know what's with
00:58
Rimmel in 25 hours they have like 10 25
01:01
hour foundations at this point I'm not
01:03
sure if they've said that they're
01:04
discontinuing this foundation but it
01:05
seems like there's some talk about that
01:07
that they are and this is kind of like
01:09
the new version of it or if they're
01:11
keeping both of these if so that's a
01:13
bummer because this is actually one of
01:14
my favorite drugstore foundations I have
01:16
a Hello older view on this foundation
01:17
like a few years old but this is one of
01:20
my all-time favorite foundations the
01:22
reason why I don't reach for this is
01:23
because it breaks me out horribly Rimmel
01:26
products there's something in them the
01:28
stay matte powder this foundation other
01:30
foundations I've tried from them there's
01:31
some ingredient that tends to give me
01:34
intense like cystic breakouts
01:36
consistently so I'm hoping that this
01:38
foundation doesn't do that for me today
01:39
but quick ode to this foundation if you
01:42
have not checked it out if you have dry
01:43
skin if you have oily skin the
01:45
foundation is beautiful across all skin
01:46
types has great coverage beautiful
01:48
finish lasts amazing throughout the day
01:50
would highly recommend you check out
01:52
this foundation if you haven't already
01:53
well let's move on to this guy so this
01:55
foundation has one fluid ounce a product
01:56
which is standard and it retails for
01:58
about $6.99 to 7:50 around there you
02:01
know when you set an alarm and you have
02:02
no idea what it was for
02:03
looking on Rimmel's website it's not
02:06
looking good folks not looking good it
02:08
has two stars and 24 reviews this
02:10
foundation comes in 16 shades which is
02:12
pretty good for the drugstore for a
02:15
first launch looking on their website it
02:16
says it's a breathable foundation
02:18
Rimmel's most lightweight long lasting
02:19
formula it perfects your skin with
02:22
medium buildable coverage moisturizes
02:24
for up to 25 hours with SPF 18 on the
02:27
bottle it says SPF 20 it is a glass
02:30
bottle and you get a actual wand
02:33
applicator in here which was surprising
02:35
to me you guys will see so I'm gonna be
02:37
swatching for you guys the three light
02:38
Chay's which r08 one fare ivory 100
02:41
ivory and 101 classic ivory some insert
02:44

02:45
these three lightest shades compared to
02:47
some of my other foundations
02:48
alright so swatch time this first shade
02:50
is the lightest shade of the Rimmel
02:51
lasting finish in 0-8 one next over is
02:54
the same foundation in 100 and 101 as
02:57
you can see there's quite a big jump
02:59
between these first two lightest shades
03:01
next over is the old lasting finish 25
03:04
hour foundation in 0-9 one this is the
03:06
lightest shade of this foundation other
03:08

proof in 101 derma call to 0-8 my
03:13
closest shade match Maybelline fit me
03:14
matte and poreless in 110 don't like
03:16
this foundation I just included it as a
03:18
swatch so you guys can see a comparison
03:19

03:20

03:22
new here you can join the burrito family
03:24

03:26
day the 15th to the 29th for 15 days
03:29
foundation I usually upload Monday
03:31
Wednesday Friday 6 p.m. sips time
03:32
alright so it's 10:40 - I've already
03:34
washed moisturize and prepped my skin
03:36
for foundation it's actually been a few
03:39
days since I filmed a1 I was in
03:40
California and while I was there I got a
03:43
little sick if I sound a little throaty
03:45
that is why I have 3 shades of this
03:46
foundation you guys have our DC and
03:48
swatches but I haven't done them yet 0 9
03:49
1 light ivory was a pretty good shade
03:51
match for me as I'm going to try and
03:52
pick one that looks closest to that in
03:54
the bottle 0 9 1 I think might be a
03:56
little bit light which is great if you
03:57
have a fair skin toner than I do
03:59
I think I'm gonna go with the second
04:00
lightest shade which is a hundred ivory
04:02
I'm gonna do half my face with a sponge
04:03
this is the LA girl sponge it rocks then
04:06
we're gonna do the other half with a
04:07
brush Sigma f80 let's give this thing a
04:09
shake Oh was not expecting that this
04:14
thing has a huge Jaffa applicator this
04:17
doesn't look like the Clinique one this
04:19
is an interesting shape looks like an
04:21
eggplant or something I guess we're just
04:23
gonna dip in and brush on the face whoo
04:27
feels like soft or something I feels
04:30
nice I don't know how much let's just
04:32
going with that I guess let's start out
04:34
with a brush on this side of my face
04:36
like I'm forgetting to do something or
04:38
say something I haven't filmed a
04:41
foundation video in like week
04:42
smells odd pretty sheer I use quite a
04:46
bit of product and that looks definitely
04:48
like light coverage basically just toned
04:50
down some of my redness but you can
04:52
still
04:52
see scarring freckles and things coming
04:54
through I think that shade is actually a
04:56
little bit dark hard to tell on camera
04:58
but yeah it looks about a shade dark I
05:00
might switch over to light a shade zero
05:02
eight one this one looks like it's gonna
05:04
be too light but maybe I'll just mix
05:06
these two shades I'm gonna build this up
05:07
with the lighter shade says it's
05:11
supposed to be buildable medium coverage
05:14
no I do not like the smell this doesn't
05:17
look like it built up a whole lot to me
05:19
I'm gonna take that lighter shade down
05:20
my neck this is a light coverage I'm
05:26
gonna do the lighter shade on my
05:27
forehead I still can't really tell which
05:30
shade I'm closer to some reason is
05:32
having a harder time blending out on my
05:34
forehead right now it looks nice and
05:36
smooth down here but on my forehead it's
05:39
kind of like clinging I think this shade
05:41
is too light the other shade is too dark
05:43
so I'm gonna mix them again on the other
05:44
side kind of at the same time this
05:46
applicator though feels hello nice feels
05:49
like you're rubbing I don't even know
05:51
what like velvet or something on your
05:53
face
05:57
for sure
05:59
light coverage it's not really covered
06:01
in any of this over here I am a mix
06:03
between these two shades not looking
06:08
great on my forehead it's making my skin
06:10
up there look really really dry let's
06:12
try and build this up again over here
06:15
getting about the same coverage with the
06:19
sponge in the brush but I like the
06:20
finish of the sponge better with this
06:23
one oh it looks so bad on my forehead on
06:29
my forehead especially just right here
06:31
not looking good it looks okay up here
06:33
but it definitely is clinging to certain
06:35
drier areas the finish down here with
06:37
the sponge looks okay and it also looks
06:39
okay on this side as well it is clinging
06:41
in certain areas again down here and
06:45
that just came off when I touch my face
06:46
I wouldn't call this buildable I don't
06:49
think I got any more coverage and I
06:51
would call this straight-up light
06:53
coverage I do have to go somewhere after
06:55
this so because it's not covering any of
06:57
the scarring and stuff on my neck I'm
06:59
just gonna take some concealer just on
07:01
my neck area and then right on this it
07:04
I'm not gonna cover anything else
07:07
because I don't want it to affect the
07:09
foundation too much right now I'm
07:10
definitely not into this in the
07:12
slightest see what the finish feels like
07:15
feels like it's setting down I think I
07:17
could blend stuff on top of this feels a
07:19
tiny bit tacky but nothing nearly as
07:21
tacky as this one that this one's like a
07:23
gel foundation so you definitely need to
07:25
set anywhere that you're gonna be
07:27
putting powder on top so it's 1058 I'm
07:29
gonna do the rest of my makeup and I'll
07:30
be right back it's 1124 we're gonna
07:32
called check-in time 11 o'clock that's
07:33
about when I finished up my face I don't
07:36
really like a single thing about this
07:38
one at this point I looked at it I would
07:39
not relighting my forehead it just looks
07:42
like it's aged me so here's what we've
07:44
got going on in natural lighting I'm
07:46
gonna do a little zoom
07:52
oh look at that forehead time for a
07:58
little flash test
08:00
I always forget to smile okay redo
08:03
there's definitely a flashback probably
08:05
because there's SPF 20 in this one or 18
08:08
my face definitely looks quite a bit
08:10
lighter than my neck in the photo so
08:12
wouldn't wear this one for blush it just
08:15
doesn't look good it looks decent in
08:17
this area not to the point where I would
08:19
want to wear it again it doesn't look
08:20
that good that's that that's how it's
08:21
looking right now this is one of those
08:23
makeup days I think I only liked about
08:25
one thing I tried on my face today so I
08:26
Chi said I wasn't planning on setting
08:28
this part of my face at all but I went
08:29
in with the essence luminous matte
08:31
bronzing powder for lighter skin this is
08:34
straight-up orange folks would not
08:37
recommend I ended up having to go with
08:39
the face powder just in this area to
08:41
tone it down and blend it out because it
08:43
looked literally orange I liked this
08:45
blush this is the bareMinerals Jen nude
08:47
in pretty and pink then I went in with a
08:49
highlighter from the Hot Topic video the
08:51
black heart highlight and it just did
08:53
not look good on my skin today so then I
08:56
tried to tone that down and fix it with
08:58
the EXO Beauty Aurora highlighter and
09:00
this kind of saved the day and then for
09:02
my eye shadow I tried out this new BH
09:03
Cosmetics glam reflection palette here
09:07
is what it looks like on the inside you
09:08
have some matte some shimmers the
09:10
shimmer shades do not like at all they
09:12
feel very scratchy and they're not super
09:14
pigmented the matte shades are nice
09:15
they're really soft and they are
09:17
pigmented so I used a few of the matte
09:18
shades on my eyes today and then I tried
09:20
to put this one just like on the center
09:22
before lips I used open decay
09:23
stark-naked comfort mat now on top of it
09:26
I tried the soap & Glory
09:27
spectacular metallic this is in the
09:30
shade gold desk it's like this rose gold
09:32
metallic kind of shade it looks pretty
09:33
shared on top of here and not super
09:35
metallic so I'm gonna have to try that
09:36
out again so that's where we're at right
09:38
now I like this about 0.5 on a scale of
09:41
10 right now if they did in fact
09:43
discontinue this like some of the
09:44
reviews are saying and replaced it with
09:46
this major downgrade
09:48
okay so right now it's 920 so it's gone
09:51
for over ten hours at this point and I
09:54
didn't do a full on check-in because I
09:55
was out if I did get some butters right
09:57
about six hours and I'm glad I got that
09:59
because it's actually looking a lot
10:00
better right now like under this
10:02
lighting then it really does and then it
10:04
looked when I was out it just does not
10:07
look good on my skin and that's pretty
10:09
much exactly what it looks like still
10:10
right now some
10:11
zoom in this is after ten hours and it
10:14
basically looks really dry now like
10:17
drier than earlier see if I can really
10:19
show you this
10:20
it's like rubbed off in certain areas
10:22
slush maybe even not because I don't
10:24
know if that was covering it in the
10:25
first place
10:26
it has oxidized about half a shade
10:28
throughout the day I noticed when I was
10:29
out to and outside of natural lighting
10:31
throughout the day so keep that in mind
10:34
this one total pass for me I don't
10:36
really see one thing that I like about
10:38
this even if you like light coverage
10:40
this one is a hard pass if you can smash
10:44
the other 25-hour foundation before they
10:46
possibly discontinue it hopefully they
10:48
don't hopefully they keep that one
10:49
because that one was bomb that one
10:51
compared to this is like no comparison
10:54
whatsoever so pick that one up if you
10:57
haven't already hopefully it doesn't
10:58
break you out like it breaks me out it's
10:59
only 9 o'clock but I feel like it's like
11:00
1:00 a.m. right now in the hello tired I
11:02
can't wait to wash my face right now if
11:04
you guys enjoyed this video and you're
11:05

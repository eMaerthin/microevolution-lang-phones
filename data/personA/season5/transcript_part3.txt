n denial that the holidays
00:01
are over and it's March alright so today
00:32
it is day three of fifteen days of
00:34
foundation this is why I try out a new
00:36
foundation every single day for 15 days
00:37
today we're gonna be talking about a
00:39
brand new foundation from cover effects
00:41
this is the powerplay foundation you get
00:44
one point one eight fluid ounces in here
00:46
which is a little bit more than the
00:48
standard one fluid ounce and it retails
00:49
for forty four dollars the super
00:52
exciting thing about this foundation is
00:54
that it comes in forty shades I love the
00:57
cover effect shade range and most of
00:59
their product not only do they have a
01:01
good shade selection but they typically
01:03
have really good undertones they have P
01:04
N and G which is golden pink neutral
01:07
golden and the cover FX drops I have the
01:08
shade n 10 which if I use them just on
01:10
their own it's a little bit light for my
01:12
skin now they used to match me about a
01:14
year and a half ago now that my skin has
01:16
somehow changed a little bit I feel like
01:18
I've gotten darker about half shade to
01:20
shade so I just use them to mix I love
01:22
those drops one of my favorite products
01:23
but I got the shade P 20 in this one I
01:26
was debating between P 20 and n 20 but
01:28
the swatches on their site looked pretty
01:30
similar in those too so I don't know I
01:32
just went with P 20 and I figured I
01:33
could mix it if I need a little bit more
01:35
pink in a foundation so it says this has
01:37
buildable medium to full coverage with a
01:39
modern matte finish supposed to control
01:41
shine and visibly blur imperfections and
01:44
stay all day without drying or dulling
01:46
the complexion it's sweat proof
01:48
waterproof transfer proof it says it's
01:50
vegan cruelty-free and I'm just now
01:52
seeing on here that the skin types they
01:54
recommend for this hour combination to
01:55
oily skin so right now I have normal to
01:58
dry skin from accutane I'm on month 5
01:59
before I Q tain I was combo oily and
02:02
after accutane I'll probably be back to
02:04
combo oily which is what I've been
02:05
reading is that your skin kind of goes
02:07
back to oily when you're off it so we'll
02:08
see but right now I'm definitely more on
02:10
normal to dry side so I'm gonna serve
02:11
swatches right here so you can see what
02:13
the shade p20 looks like compared to
02:14
some of my other foundations
02:16
all right so swatches the third over is
02:17
actually the powerplay foundation I was
02:19

03:01
so I haven't actually posted the
03:02
announcement video I post it tonight
03:03
alright here we go if you want to see my
03:05
thoughts on the cover effects power play
03:06
foundation you're in the right place
03:08
just keep watching I just have this hair
03:10
sitting on my table right now
03:12
these are clip-on bangs that I got off
03:15
of wish would not recommend okay it's
03:18
8:07 in the morning March 1st has
03:21
actually been about I think about a week
03:23
since I filmed so I feel a little out of
03:25
it right now I actually got really sick
03:27
and now I have some kind of weird throat
03:30
thing that I'm on antibiotics for but
03:32
had to start filming so this shade p20
03:35
looks promising it might actually be a
03:37
little bit light we'll see looking
03:39
against my neck my face is a lot darker
03:41
and more red than my body so here's what
03:44
the packaging looks like it is just a
03:45
squeeze kind of tube right here I don't
03:47
mind a squeeze tube I actually kind of
03:49
like it because it's super easy I'm
03:51
gonna shake this because it seems pretty
03:53
liquidy I've already washed moisturize
03:55
prepped my skin the products I've been
03:57
using will be linked down below in the
03:58
description box half my face I'm gonna
04:00
use my la girl sponge which is dampen
04:02
the other half my Sigma f80 I'm gonna go
04:04
in oh I think this is gonna be too late
04:08
so it's supposed to be medium to full
04:10
coverage I think the shade will be fine
04:12
once I warm up my face and everything
04:14
mmm I don't know I feel like one shade
04:16
darker would almost be too dark maybe I
04:18
should have gone for the neutral because
04:20
this one's looking a tiny bit pink
04:21
it is the pee undertone oh that looks
04:25
nice on the forehead it looks pretty
04:27
matte but it looks very smooth it's
04:29
already majorly creasing right here holy
04:33
shit cease so this bun just looking like
04:35
medium coverage it feels like a lot more
04:40
matte or something on this side like it
04:42
has this grip to it it's not hard to
04:44
blend out it's just drying super super
04:46
quick I definitely need that sponge just
04:49
smooth out around my nose I am getting
04:52
better coverage with a brush it's not
04:54
looking great but it's not looking bad
05:00
prefer this sponge on my forehead I'm
05:04
gonna smooth it out I feel like this one
05:06
is very matte and it dries super quickly
05:10
so I do like how you have a little bit
05:13
more time to work with it with a sponge
05:14
my forehead looks great everywhere else
05:17
I'm not loving how it looks have a few
05:20
dry patches right now around my mouth
05:22
right here and then also some under my
05:24
nose just from below my nose 5000 times
05:27
this side I got much lighter coverage on
05:29
this side but you can still see a lot
05:32
coming through so I'm gonna try and do a
05:34
thin kind of second layer just on the
05:36
areas I need it I'm not gonna do my
05:38
forehead I'm just gonna do right here
05:39
and right here to see if we can build it
05:41
up and I'm gonna do it with a sponge
05:43
because I definitely prefer the finish
05:45
with the sponge and like I said it dries
05:47
hella quick so sponge with a little bit
05:50
of moisture is definitely the way to go
05:51
that built but I still wouldn't say it's
05:58
full coverage now it just looks like
05:59
solid medium coverage like doing
06:02
something weird on my dry patches around
06:04
my mouth nor this lip peeling I know but
06:07
look at how frickin dry and crepey and
06:11
just how much it's creasing right there
06:13
and then also on this side the dryness
06:15
it is clinging right here forehead looks
06:18
pretty nice and it's not clinging
06:19
anywhere on my forehead I do feel like I
06:21
can really feel this on my face right
06:23
now I wouldn't say it feels really
06:24
lightweight or anything I don't know I'm
06:26
gonna do the rest of my makeup and then
06:27
I'll be right back okay so right now
06:29
it's 854 I'm gonna call the check-in
06:31
time 8:30 because I've just been forever
06:33
and a half
06:34
the rest of my makeup there's a lot of
06:35
fuss I'm done by Clint now looking at
06:38
the foundation so the one thing I like
06:39
at this point is that it is kind of self
06:42
setting I didn't have to use any kind of
06:43
a setting powder to blend out product on
06:46
top of here so I don't have any powder
06:47
on my face right now and this does say
06:48
it's supposed to be oil controlling to
06:50
so if you do have oily skin this might
06:51
be one that might help control oil
06:53
throughout the day I'm hoping this
06:54
doesn't make me super dry because of
06:56
that so I like that it was easy to blend
06:57
product on top I definitely don't feel
06:59
like I need a powder it doesn't feel
07:00
super tacky or anything it does feel
07:03
like it's set down so I do like that as
07:05
far as how it's looking I am getting
07:08
major friggin creases I mean around my
07:11
mouth this is bad like I rarely get this
07:14
bad of creasing around this area I
07:16
usually get my creasing right in here it
07:19
looks very makeup be it looks great on
07:22
my areas like right here where I don't
07:24
have a lot of texture and stuff but
07:25
anywhere where I have texture pores
07:28
where I usually get creasing like all
07:30
this whole area right here is not
07:33
looking great my forehead looks pretty
07:35
good it is starting to crease a little
07:37
bit up here it looks pretty nice from
07:39
far away it's just when I get up close
07:41
or I'm like yikes as of right now I
07:44
wouldn't put this on my face again alone
07:46
if I did use this again the thing with
07:48
mixing is I always try and mix two
07:51
products that I like something in one
07:53
that the other one might be missing but
07:55
I have to like both foundations it's
07:57
just they're better together if that
07:59
makes sense so with this foundation I
08:00
think the only thing I would kind of use
08:02
this for mixing is the pink tone if I
08:04
had a super yellow tone foundation that
08:06
I wanted to kind of lighten and add a
08:07
little pink I could use this but the
08:09
coverage isn't really something I would
08:10
mix it for and the finish is definitely
08:12
not something I would mix it for and it
08:14
is very matte so if I mix this with
08:16
something it would be something like the
08:18
Estee Lauder Double Wear nude that's
08:20
really the only way I see myself using
08:22
this as mixing it so on the rest of my
08:23
face for bronzer I use the bronze & Glow
08:26
by makeup revolution this looked a lot
08:28
warmer today than the first time I used
08:30
it I don't know it looked like very warm
08:32
I've been obsessed with this blush and
08:33
it was a limited edition so I need to
08:35
stop using it but is the Mac bareness
08:37
extra dimension blush I got this off of
08:39
glambot and it's just such a pretty like
08:41
glowy neutral color for a highlight I
08:43
tried out this new NARS hi
08:45
this is the Capri highlight it's like
08:48
this light pink shade this was beautiful
08:51
the packaging so nice on my lips I used
08:55
one of my favourites l'oreal infallible
08:56
tongue-tied it's like one of my go-to
08:58
colors i topped it off with the
08:59
maybelline vivid hot lacquer in the
09:02
shade tees and then my eye shadow i
09:04
actually tried the bad habit or a
09:06
palette my cousin used this in the 10
09:09
year old does my makeup video but I
09:11
actually haven't tried it until today
09:12
this is supposed to be an Anastasia dupe
09:14
I did a whole video comparing a hush
09:16
subculture dupe against another dupe and
09:18
that was a total fail but in the
09:20
comments a bunch of you guys said to try
09:21
out this palette because this one is
09:22
supposed to be really good and so far I
09:25
like this out of the shades I used this
09:27
was really pretty this is all of my
09:29
eyeshadows today except for the purple
09:31
I used this purple liner this is the
09:33
L'Oreal infallible and purple violet and
09:35
then just blended some bright purple
09:37
shadow from the BH Cosmetics zodiac
09:38
palette I'm gonna have to try this more
09:40
but definitely went much better than the
09:43
other hush palette and I think that's
09:45
everything
09:45
I'll give you guys a little update on
09:47
this brow product since I mentioned it
09:48
in the drugstore try on haul video I've
09:50
been using this almost every single day
09:53
and the thing with this is that the
09:54
applicator on this sucks
09:56
like the applicator is horrible you get
09:59
way too much product out on this little
10:01
wand thing what I've been doing is just
10:03
taking my eyebrow brush and just going
10:06
right in to either the tip or just even
10:08
right here and then going in and just
10:10
filling in my brows and it works amazing
10:12
it does last through water is a very
10:14
long-lasting I like how it just kind of
10:16
like stays there stays in place so I've
10:19
been really liking this if you use it in
10:20
a different way like don't use the
10:22
applicator just as like a menu review
10:24
session so I'm gonna show you guys what
10:25
this thing looks like in natural
10:26
lighting right now and then we're gonna
10:27
do a little flash test it's a crazy fact
10:29
we actually have Sun right now so I'm
10:31
standing in front of the window and
10:33
natural lighting right now so here's
10:36
that weird creasing and clinging also
10:41
you can see it clinging to my dryness
10:43
right here and are decreasing over here
10:46
it seems to be almost actually rubbing
10:49
off a little bit right here or something
10:51
I didn't see that before
10:52
but also a tiny bit on the center of my
10:56
forehead hopefully that doesn't get
10:58
worse throughout the day
10:59
but I've definitely seen my forehead
11:01
look worse especially with kind of matte
11:04
oil controlling foundation so it doesn't
11:06
look horrible but here it is in natural
11:08
lighting so let's go do a little flash
11:10
test
11:10
I always forget I need my phone for this
11:12
and got a photo with the wall oh look
11:18
and ghostly
11:19
why does flash make your teeth look so
11:21
yellow what's up with that flash I don't
11:23
see that this has SPF in it online so
11:25
check-in time is 8:30 I'll see you guys
11:27
in a few hours in natural lighting what
11:29
time is it 116 so it's been on for
11:31
almost 5 hours got my hot back on right
11:34
now so it's looking pretty crappy not
11:38
loving how it looks I look hella dry
11:40
like even drier than this morning and
11:43
crustier than this morning Oh like
11:46
that's dryness from like I said blowing
11:48
my nose and stuff so that's gonna be
11:50
there but my lip lines right here have
11:52
definitely gotten worse around here this
11:55
whole area looks really gross yeah I
11:58
definitely don't love how my forehead
12:00
looks now it looks super dry keep in
12:03
mind they do say this is more for combo
12:05
oily skin and it is supposed to have oil
12:07
controlling properties throughout the
12:09
day so I wasn't expecting it to really
12:10
like keep my skin moisturize and stuff
12:13
so I easily could look much better on
12:15
oily skin this is just my skin so we're
12:17
testing it don't really have a choice I
12:19
feel pretty cool if you could like
12:20
switch between skin types don't love it
12:22
right now
12:23
we'll see how it wears at the end of the
12:25
night well I think we will be testing
12:27
this waterproof claim because I just
12:29
posted the announcement video literally
12:32
20 minutes ago in my time today and I've
12:35
just been getting a little most reading
12:37
all of your comments I love you guys and
12:38
I so appreciate everyone who has already
12:40
bought a t-shirt just in the first like
12:42
20 minutes that the videos been up and
12:44
I'm just so excited to see what you guys
12:47
can do throughout this 15 days it's
12:50
actually now oh there's my alarm for
12:52
this it's now 6:40 so it's been on for
12:54
10 hours wow I am so dry over here and
12:58
now it is like totally peeling off ooh
13:01
that is like crusty it looks pretty much
13:06
the same as last check-in but I actually
13:08
feel like I'm even drier you can see my
13:11
skin
13:11
peeling in certain areas that could be
13:13
because of like the oil controlling
13:14
thing and my skin is already dry it is
13:16
supposed to be transfer proof so I'm
13:19
wearing a white sweater so don't want to
13:20
like hug myself but I am gonna use just
13:22
the back of my hand and kind of press
13:25
see this transfer proof feels like a
13:29
powder I don't really see anything on my
13:32
hand look in the mirror let's try my
13:35
nose I can't really tell just a tiny bit
13:38
on my hand not stayed on my nose pretty
13:41
well so I guess that's exciting if
13:43
you're looking for like a transfer proof
13:44
yeah it's really not it's not rubbing
13:48
off so that's exciting if that's the
13:50
only thing I like about this with like
13:52
the pink undertone that could be enough
13:54
incentive for me to mix this in with
13:56
something if we want to make something
13:57
last a little bit longer and be transfer
13:59
proof then I potentially might mix in
14:02
like a drop of this but this is so
14:04
freakin matte and dry that I feel like
14:06
on my skin right now it's just not the
14:08
best but I think in about a month when
14:09
I'm off accutane and my skin is a little
14:11
bit more normal
14:12
oily again probably I would try this out
14:14
again so if you have a very very oily
14:17
skin you might want to get a sample this
14:19
one if you can't ask for and try it out
14:20
because it does seem to be like very
14:23
second all the moisture out of my skin
14:25
which I know is something I probably
14:26
would have liked when I had oily skin
14:28
mature skin any kind of creasing texture
14:31
stay away from this one like I said I'm
14:34
getting creasing in places I normally
14:35
don't at all that's how I feel about
14:37
this one definitely I think made for
14:39
oily skin and would not call this full
14:41
coverage I think this is about medium
14:43
coverage that's that so don't forget the
14:45
link to vote one time a day is down
14:46
below link two t-shirts is down below if
14:49
